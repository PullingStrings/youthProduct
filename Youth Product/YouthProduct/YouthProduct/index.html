They were travelling to Bujumbura, the nation’s capital, seeking treatment to his illness. Her brother died on the journey. Vumilia, terrified and devastated, pretended her brother was asleep until they arrived in the city.<br><br>The 27-year- old’s father and eight of her brothers died at Mutabira refugee camp, on the Tanzanian border. The family fled there during Burundi’s civil war. When Vumilia, her mother, three younger sisters and remaining brother returned to her father’s land in 2009, her grandparents, who had been farming the land, turned them away.

Agency is crucial. A key question, however, is: what is agency for adolescent girls?<div><br></div><div>Over almost four years operating in Burundi, POWER observed that adolescent girls’ agency involves their having the confidence and skills to retain assets in marriage and delay marriage; using their voice to ask for what they need to succeed, for example in asking POWER for more training and opportunities, and challenging land inheritance and child custody laws and customs; using the system to push for change by taking legal action to gain their rights;&nbsp;</div><div>and having bold aspirations for the future for business growth and development and asset ownership.</div><div><br></div><div>Most important, however, is that this definition is not static. Girls are defining what their own agency means in practice by deciding their own futures, making their own choices, and pushing the boundaries to achieve their goals. Respecting girls as agents of change – allowing them to decide what they need, when and how – created a valuable feedback loop. It allowed the project to flexibly respond to girls’ needs and requests.</div><div><br></div><div>What makes adolescent girls special is that in defining their own agency they are not confined by boundaries or restricted in their aspirations – like teenagers the world over - and will push to change the status quo.</div></div>

Many girls felt that if their business is&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">going well, school provided no benefits.

They are more likely to attend school than non-VSLA members, but as the POWER&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Africa project has continued that likelihood has continued to decrease.

There is a growing trend throughout POWER Africa for</div><div>girls, particularly those who have their own children, to choose not to attend school in order to</div><div>dedicate their time to their businesses. This in direct contrast to the goals and aspirations of</div><div>parents, teachers, local and international NGOs, and government policies and development</div><div>plans. Some girls plan to return to school, but the trend coexists with those relating to dropout</div><div>rates.

They face entrenched gender inequalities that prevent&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">their achieving financial independence and business success. Typically, Burundian society&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">does not accept girls supporting themselves and gaining independence, as this pushes the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">envelope of acceptable gender norms and makes girls undesirable for marriage.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Through its client-centric programming and feedback loops that are at the heart&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">of the programme, CARE was able to identify who and how important its different&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">stakeholders were to overcome these obstacles.For girls to lead themselves out of poverty, they needed the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">support of their teachers, parents, brothers and male community leaders to ensure the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">stability and safety necessary to start businesses and invest their profits.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Adolescent girls in Burundi are excluded from accessing sustainable financial services as they are</div><div>considered a high-risk group by both communities and formal financial sectors. In Burundian</div><div>communes, the law does not recognise girls owning assets, meaning that if there is ever an</div><div>ownership dispute, they remain vulnerable as their assets will not be regarded as their own.</div><div><br></div><div>They are limited by a lack of access to land and other productive resources by parents who&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">often prefer to favour boys with such privileges. If a teenage girl falls pregnant, her parents&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">will often chase her from the family home and she may suffer abuse and stigma by the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">child’s father and other members of the community. From a young age, boys are taught&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">about the importance of respect within a ‘model’ household, a crucial part of which is girls’</span></div><div>submission to their husbands.</div><div><br></div><div>POWER Africa had to work with parents, men, teachers and community leaders for its</div><div>programme to be successful. Daphrose was isolated by her family. Her community had vilified</div><div>her and questioned her ambitions.

However, he had heard positive things about&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">projects like POWER Africa and decided to let his wife join a VSLA. Now the family has been&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">able to save money from his wife’s business.</span><div><br></div><div>During interviews with participants, the issue of girls’ brothers and the attitudes of males&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">more generally repeatedly came up. The engagement of men and boys in the target&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">communities was identified as an essential component early on in the project. During&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">POWER’s monitoring process, girls specifically identified older brothers as posing a serious&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">risks to asset security, as they are known to seize girls’ livestock, products and valuable&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">assets.</span></div><div><br></div><div>It was a revelation when the POWER team realised this was occurring as they did not initially&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">know the girls’ brothers were seizing their assets. It remains a major challenge. POWER&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">learned that brothers were jealous of their sisters’ success. Girls’ assets are seen as the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">family’s assets as opposed to their own, and men and boys want to maintain the status quo&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">of gender norms.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Gender inequality was a major impediment to the success of the saving groups and after only two months of group activities in Burundi, POWER Africa realised it needed to organise community meetings to address the issue. It was another example of focusing on clients and implementing a feedback loop that saw the project listen and act on what participants said.</span></div><div><br></div><div>POWER realised there were men who were willing to help, like the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Abatangamucho. Abatangamucho, an initiative established by CARE Burundi&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">that works in conjunction with POWER Africa, are community-embedded male&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">change agents. They are male leaders who are ready to listen and support the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">girls’ efforts. They acted as champions for the girls’ rights and were crucial to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">their success.</span></div><div><br></div><div>CARE data showed that if there was a strong male change agent in the community, it led to&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">increased parental support for the adolescent girls, increased mobility rates, and helped&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">girls to be able to sell their products outside of their homes. Of those surveyed, 33% of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">parents cited the Abatangamucho as a facilitating factor for the girls’ success in the POWER&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">programme.</span></div><div><br></div><div>In community meetings, the Abatangamucho spoke about equality between the sexes, the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">sharing of roles and responsibilities between couples and brothers and sisters, and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">emphasised there is no work reserved for one sex. Older brothers, however, continued to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">seize the girls’ assets.</span></div></div>

Initially, teachers were wary due&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">to fears that girls would ignore their studies as they focused on their businesses. VSLA&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">participants, however, said teachers must be involved after POWER had not engaged them&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">directly.

Before the POWER Africa project, there were a lot of girls without work&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">or schooling who were misled by boys in the community.

The 24 year old from Kayanza struggled after her father died. Her mother could not earn enough to pay school fees or feed Charlotte and her brothers.<br><br>In 2014 Charlotte joined her local VSLA group. A few months later, the Abatangamucho ran a gender equality training session for the men in the community. They spoke about the sharing of gender-specific roles and responsibilities. This gave Charlotte an idea: she could become a bicycle-taxi driver, a job typically reserved for boys and men.<br><br>Adolescent girls in POWER have been shown to be innovative, to move quickly, and are willing to take calculated risks in taking loans and venturing into non-traditional businesses. In a word, they are dynamic. They have a growing capacity for financial education, as well as business and money management, and apply these skills to undertake higher value business activities. These skills enable them to invest in land, building or buying houses, cows, small animals, bicycles, motorcycles, sewing machines and their own or their children’s education. Many of these investments are traditionally reserved for men’s control and ownership.<br></p>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Before Charlotte could buy a bicycle and begin her transportation business, she took a loan&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">from her VSLA to buy and sell bananas. Once she earned BIF 70,000(USD$40), she bought a bike and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">started transporting passengers and goods. Boys in the industry thought that as a girl she&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">would soon abandon the business. Girls in her community told her to quit, that she would&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">not be able to find a husband if she spent so much time with bicycle taxi boys.</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>Markets in Burundi are relatively ‘thin’, so most new businesses that are started are novel&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">and lack competitors. Girls in the POWER programme used their market assessment skills to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">their advantage and tended to diversify their businesses as opposed to expanding them.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">They leverage success in one market to pursue success in another. For example, they might&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">take a loan to buy tomatoes to sell, which they made a profit on; then they would use the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">profits to buy piglets; they could then sell the sow (the female), and use the profits to buy&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">land.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Charlotte is still studying and operates her taxi business outside of school hours. She also&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">owns seven goats and continues to run her banana business. She has been able to attain all&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">her assets as a result of being a participant in POWER and making a profit from her own&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">businesses.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Many other participants in the POWER programme manage multiple business ventures.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">They begin by running a small business while building capital, expand into a more lucrative&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">sector while continuing to run their original business, and collect assets, like livestock</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, along the way.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Accruing land and assets is a form of security for girls against theft – resilience in the face of&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">instability. POWER data showed more VSLA members reported investing in assets than non-VSLA members – 85.8% compared to 61.8%, respectively. Land is harder to come by, with only 6.8% of members reporting purchasing land in the past 12 months,</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;yet it confers more&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">benefits in terms of legally being in girls’ names and unable to be seized.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>As adolescent girls in Burundi establish and expand their businesses.</strong> They add value to their&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">communities through job creation, which is multifaceted. By hiring employees, girls benefit&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">in business growth, as this enables them to manage their time between multiple businesses,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">and to increase their productivity. It also shifts gender norms, demonstrating women’s&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">capacity for leadership and business acumen. In some cases those norms are flipped as girls&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">are hiring boys as assistants, which is becoming more common.</span></div></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">The success of girls’ businesses posed a dilemma for the POWER Africa project. As their&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">businesses grew and flourished, girls were unable to access enough credit through their&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">VSLA groups to cover their loan needs for continued business growth. Some members were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">joining two or three groups to obtain multiple loans. They wanted to be linked into the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">formal banking system for greater security and access to higher loans and credit.</span><div><br></div><div>The key question for CARE remains: how do you know when it’s time to link? The&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">challenge is&nbsp;in balancing the programme’s client-centric approach against the ‘do no&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">harm’ principles&nbsp;inherent to working with adolescent girls. With access to higher value loans, there was a risk&nbsp;the girls would&nbsp;take&nbsp;on too much debt and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">default on their loans.&nbsp;CARE&nbsp;trod&nbsp;cautiously and&nbsp;learned valuable lessons on when and how to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">incorporate linkage into its POWER programme.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Muhorakeye Bénigne, 23-years- old and from Ngozi, used the profits she invested from a&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">loan from her VSLA group to trade bananas and goats and purchase a farm. She hopes to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">buy a motorcycle to use as a taxi, then expand the business with a car. She also hopes to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">build a store. She said it will be easy for her to access enough credit to fund her ambitions&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">because her VSLA group is connected to a bank.</span></div><div><br></div><div>It was not always so straightforward for VSLA members to get credit from a bank. CARE was&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">slow to react to the demand, cautious of which bank the groups could link with and what&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">impact it would have. Even now, linkage is still in a pilot phase and girls are saving money at the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">bank but cannot yet contract loans through the programme.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) approached CARE during the first year of the project looking&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">to link with VSLA groups and consistently pursued CARE to form a partnership and connect&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">them with groups. However, this supply-driven approach is in direct contradiction to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">POWER’s client-driven approach in best meeting the needs of adolescent girls. CARE slowed&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">down the process with KCB to better focus on quality and its ‘do no harm’ approach.</span></div><div><br></div><div>As Abatangamucho increased their presence in communities and amplified the girls’&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">demand to access the formal banking system, CARE decided it must further research linking&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">the girls to the formal banking systems.</span></div></div>

Ultimately, KCB was chosen as the best partner according to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">fees, transfers, access to bank accounts, and transfer costs.</span><div><br></div><div>It was also important to consider the stability of the institution. Financial services providers&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">(FSPs), particularly microfinance institutions (MFIs), have a history of instability in Burundi&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">that has left many Burundians wary of linkage. KCB’s products were sound and they took the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">initiative to go to the villages with CARE to train and speak to girls.</span></div><div><br></div><div>KCB works through a network of agents that earn commission from the bank and are mobile&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">throughout their areas, providing adequate access to the different target communities.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Further, KCB had a mobile money option available, again increasing girls’ access to products&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">and services.</span></div><div><br></div><div>As CARE negotiated with KCB, it was essential to engage the girls and act on their feedback&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">on the linkage process. The client-centric approach and feedback loops at the centre of the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">POWER programme once again came into play.</span></div><div><br></div><div>A pilot for savings-only bank accounts for 20 groups was launched. GLID mobilised and&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">sensitised groups on the possibilities for linkage, the benefits and asked if they wanted to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">link. Girls were given time to think and were told to approach their field officers if they were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">interested, after which they set up a meeting with KCB.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Mobilising and speaking with groups helped to mitigate the problem of gaining consensus&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">among group members to link. In these joint meetings between KCB and the groups, KCB&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">explained their products and services to the girls, and girls provided feedback and asked&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">questions. CARE wanted to make sure that girls’ opinions, concerns, and ideas were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">included in the bank’s product design process and ensure this feedback was incorporated&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">into their negotiations.</span></div><div><br></div><div>When the pilot phase is completed, CARE will use the community scorecard to evaluate the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">process, services and products so that KCB, CARE, GLID and the girls can provide feedback&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">and engage in discussion to continue improving the process and available products.</span></div></div>

This low&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">usage rate implies that some members are either too far from the bank branch and do not&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">have easy access to deposit or withdrawal services in the absence of mobile banking, or that&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">they simply are not making use of their accounts.</span></div></div>

More importantly, girls are quick to apply concepts to their contexts. Programming should support this rapid growth. Flexibility is central to this: training needs to be shorter and more focused, girls need access to formal financial service providers quickly, entrepreneurship and business support needs to be tailored to meet girls’ needs.</p>
